                <p>
                    I am building a web-based community platform exclusively for game developers. 
                    This application will allow game developers to showcase their 
                    ongoing game projects and build a dedicated following. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers will be able to make posts, polls, and open discussions about their game, 
                    allowing them to gain insight from their community and determine which 
                    features may be a good idea to implement. There are also systems that allow users
                    to follow developers and like/dislike posts and comments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is my first major project involving full-stack software development.
                    Currently it is built entirely with Django along with a bit of JavaScript. 
                    Moving forward, I plan to implement a front-end framework such as React to improve the user experience.
                </p>
